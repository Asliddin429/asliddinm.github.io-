            Initially, your reading speed might be around 200 words per minute. However, after a month of regular practice, significant progress can be achieved. Personally, I increased my reading speed to 400 words per minute and now average 800 words per minute in French and about 600 words per minute in English.

            Its important to note that reading speed can vary depending on the difficulty of the text. Non-fiction books on familiar topics can be read faster, while fiction may require more time. These indicators are not absolute but serve as markers of progress.
